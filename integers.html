  <h1>Understanding Integers</h1>
  
  <h2>What are Integers?</h2>
  <p>Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They do not have any fractional or decimal parts.</p>
  
  <h2>Examples of Integers:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Positive Integers: 1, 2, 100, 1000</li>
    <li>Negative Integers: -1, -50, -100</li>
    <li>Zero: 0</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Representing Integers on a Number Line:</h2>
  <p>An integer can be represented on a number line. Positive integers are to the right of zero, and negative integers are to the left of zero.</p>

  <h2>Operations with Integers:</h2>
  <p>Integers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided just like other numbers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Addition: 5 + (-3) = 2</li>
    <li>Subtraction: 10 - 8 = 2</li>
    <li>Multiplication: (-4) * 3 = -12</li>
    <li>Division: 20 / (-5) = -4</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>Integers are whole numbers that include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. They are used in various mathematical operations and can be represented on a number line.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Fractions</h2>
      <p>Fractions represent parts of a whole. They consist of a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).</p>
      <h3>Examples of Fractions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Proper Fractions: 1/2, 3/4, 5/6</li>
        <li>Improper Fractions: 7/4, 10/3, 15/2</li>
        <li>Mixed Numbers: 1 1/2, 2 3/4, 3 2/5</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Representing Fractions:</h3>
      <p>Fractions can be represented on a number line or in visual diagrams to depict the portion of a whole.</p>

      <h3>Operations with Fractions:</h3>
      <p>Fractions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided by following specific rules for each operation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Addition: 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12</li>
        <li>Subtraction: 5/6 - 2/3 = 1/6</li>
        <li>Multiplication: 2/5 * 3/4 = 6/20 (or simplified to 3/10)</li>
        <li>Division: 3/4 / 1/2 = 3/2 (or simplified to 1 1/2)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <p>Fractions represent parts of a whole and can be proper fractions, improper fractions, or mixed numbers. They are used in various mathematical operations and can be represented visually.</p>
